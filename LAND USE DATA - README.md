LAND USE DATA ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ACTIVITY IS FROM USDA NASS: [https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:3df4f339-6a90-4200-81cf-4c3cdced34f7_fc291ccc-3ba9-450b-94b7-2291298d22a1@unq.g](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Cropland/Release/index.php)
In this example we used 2024 data with 30 x 30 meter resolution, but you can swap out for any year that makes sense for you.
Make sure to update the .tif name to match whatever file end up uploading.
Alternatively you can use Cropscaper to query landuse data remotely.
The Land use file is too big to host locally on GitHub (2.5Gb) so here's a Google Drive Folder where you can download it yourself: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13Fx27fbMuqW0ME3UU8WP4cWr71u3C0ip?usp=sharing
